<p>Iâ€™m an iOS/Android developer, having a degree in applied mathematics, living in Moscow, Russia. Currently I spend my days working as software engineer and self-studying. I'm interested in computer science, math, computer vision. I have a keen interest in functional and reactive programming.  Also I have a basic knowledge in back end development and front end engineering.  
Aside from development, I enjoy spending my time with my wife and daughters, watching sports (mostly EPL and NBA), playing guitar.</p>
